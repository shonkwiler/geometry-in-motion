# Geometry in Motion
Source code for animations by [Clayton Shonkwiler](https://shonkwiler.org).

These animations were created in [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/); if you do not have Mathematica installed on your machine, you can still open and view the notebooks using the free [Wolfram Player](https://www.wolfram.com/player/). I have also added a comment at the top of each source file with a link to a web view of the notebook.

Source code for older animations can be found (in a not very searchable or user-friendly way) on the [Wolfram Community](https://community.wolfram.com/web/claytonshonkwiler).
